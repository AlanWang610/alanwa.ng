About me
======
I'm currently a predoctoral research fellow at MIT Sloan, working on topics in cryptocurrency and consumer finance.

I recently graduated from Harvard College with a AB and SM in applied mathematics, and a secondary in integrative biology.

On the weekends, I'm usually doing some combination of running, biking, swimming, and lifting weights.

Student life
======
At Harvard, I was an analyst on consulting projects with [HDAG](https://www.huanalytics.org/) and ran a semesterly intro to python bootcamp with [HODP](https://www.hodp.org/). Outside of school, I ran workouts with [HCRC](http://harvardrunningclub.com/) and was a part of [AADT](https://www.harvardaadt.org/). I also taught at [Chinatown ACCESS](https://www.chinatownaccess.org/) (an afterschool program).

I was a also course assistant for [ECON 1011b](https://scholar.harvard.edu/chodorow-reich/classes/economics-1011b-intermediate-macroeconomics-spring-2015-0) and [APMTH 120](https://climate.fas.harvard.edu/classes/amp-120-applied-linear-algebra-and-big-data).

In previous summers, I conducted biomechanics research with the [Biewener lab](https://biewenerlab.oeb.harvard.edu/) on physiological responses to exertion in Nymphicus Hollandicus. I also interned at a quantitative trading firm.
