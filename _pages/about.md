About me
======
I'm a senior at Harvard College studying applied mathematics in economics, with a secondary in integrative biology. I'll be starting as a predoctoral research fellow at MIT Sloan in Fall 2024, working under Prof. Antoinette Schoar.

On the weekends, I'm usually doing some combination of running, biking, swimming, and lifting weights.

Student life
======
On campus, I work as an analyst on consulting projects with [HDAG](https://www.huanalytics.org/) and run a semesterly intro to python bootcamp with [HODP](https://www.hodp.org/). Outside of school, I run workouts with [HCRC](http://harvardrunningclub.com/) and am a part of [AADT](https://www.harvardaadt.org/). I also teach at [Chinatown ACCESS](https://www.chinatownaccess.org/) (an afterschool program).

I'm currently a course assistant for [ECON 1011b](https://scholar.harvard.edu/chodorow-reich/classes/economics-1011b-intermediate-macroeconomics-spring-2015-0) at Harvard.

In previous summers, I conducted biomechanics research with the [Biewener lab](https://biewenerlab.oeb.harvard.edu/) on physiological responses to exertion in Nymphicus Hollandicus. Last summer, I was an intern at a quantitative trading firm.
